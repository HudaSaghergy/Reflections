When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
  when a new feature is done and i want to share it in public

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
	some changes might havw been done by others and i want to make sure i agree with them before pulling them

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
	fork: is copying a repository from and onto the GitHub servers all online
	clone: is copying a repository from the server onto my computer or from and onto my computer
