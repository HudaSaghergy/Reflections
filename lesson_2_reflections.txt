What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
	a hidden folder called .git is created 
	so that it would keep track of my files' history

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
	it's a middle area bettween the both of them it lets you chunck changes and think about them 
	before making a commit
